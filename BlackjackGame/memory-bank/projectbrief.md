# Project Brief

## Overview

This project is a Blackjack game implemented as an Android application. The core game logic is separated from the UI, allowing for potential reuse or adaptation to other platforms.

## Goals

-   Implement a functional Blackjack game with standard rules.
-   Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
-   Design a modular and maintainable codebase.
-   Provide a solid foundation for future expansion (e.g., adding more game features, multiplayer support).
